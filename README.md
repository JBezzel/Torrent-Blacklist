# Torrent-Blacklist
Attempting to create a Community Torrent-Blacklist
Currently experimenting with pfBlockerng dev.  Will welcome any suggestions and/recommendations to improve this list.  I am not against torrenting however there is a time and a place and it shouldnt be done at anothers expense.  
The best defense is education and this is not designed to solve all your torrent problems.  It is designed to make it inconvenient for unwanted torrenting on your network.
